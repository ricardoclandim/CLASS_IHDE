# Modification of CLASS (v2.9) for interacting Holographic dark energy

This is a modified version of [CLASS](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public), based in turn on the modified version by [Matteo Lucca](https://github.com/luccamatteo/class_iDMDE), for interacting holographic dark energy (https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10205).  The main modifications with respect to the original version are in input.c, background.c and .h, thermodynamics.c, nonlinear.c and perturbations.c (with comments "BEGIN/END MODIFICATION RL").


Please visit the orginal CLASS page for installation instructions.
